Key features and benefits of arrow functions:

{{c1::**Concise Syntax**: Arrow functions have a shorter syntax compared to traditional function expressions, making code more compact and readable.}}

{{c1::**Lexical `this` Binding**: Arrow functions do not have their own `this` value.
Instead, they inherit the `this` value from the surrounding scope.
This behavior can help avoid confusion and simplify the handling of `this` context.}}

{{c1::**Implicit Return**: If the function body consists of a single expression, arrow functions can omit the curly braces `{}` and the `return` keyword.
The result of the expression is implicitly returned.}}
