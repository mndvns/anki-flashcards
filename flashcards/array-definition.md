What are arrays in JavaScript?

===

Arrays are list-like objects that store multiple values in a single object.

- Arrays allow accessing individual values and performing operations efficiently, like looping through the list.
- Without arrays, storing and manipulating multiple values would be more complex and error-prone.
- Arrays are especially useful when dealing with large amounts of data, simplifying tasks like printing and totaling values.
