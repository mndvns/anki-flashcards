Programming languages are either compiled or interpreted.
Which is JavaScript? {{c1::Interpreted.}}

===

In programming, there are interpreted and compiled languages:

- Interpreted languages run code from top to bottom, returning results immediately without transformation.
- Compiled languages transform code into another form (binary code) before running it.

JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted language:

- JavaScript code is received by the browser in its original text form and directly executed.
- Modern JavaScript interpreters use just-in-time compiling for better performance.
- JavaScript is still considered interpreted because compilation happens at runtime, not ahead of time.
