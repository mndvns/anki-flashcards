A **programming paradigm** is an approach or style of programming that provides a set of principles and guidelines for structuring and solving problems using programming languages.
It defines how programs should be designed, organized, and executed.

JavaScript is a versatile language that supports multiple programming paradigms, meaning it allows developers to write code using different styles or approaches.
The main programming paradigms associated with JavaScript are:

**Procedural Programming**: In this paradigm, the program's logic is organized around {{c1::procedures or functions}} that operate on data.
JavaScript allows procedural programming by {{c1::defining and invoking functions to perform specific tasks}}.

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: OOP emphasizes the concept of {{c1::objects that encapsulate}} data and behavior.
JavaScript supports OOP through {{c1::object creation, inheritance, and polymorphism}}.
Developers can {{c1::define classes, create objects, and use inheritance and encapsulation}} to build complex systems.

**Functional Programming**: Functional programming treats computation as {{c1::the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids}} changing state and mutable data.
JavaScript provides features like {{c1::higher-order functions, anonymous functions, and first-class functions that facilitate functional programming}}.

**Event-Driven Programming**: JavaScript, particularly in the context of {{c1::web development}}, is well-suited for event-driven programming.
It involves writing code that responds to {{c1::events such as clicks, mouse movements, or user interactions}}.
JavaScript allows attaching {{c1::event handlers to elements and executing specific code in response to events}}.

By supporting multiple paradigms, JavaScript provides developers with flexibility in choosing the most appropriate approach based on the problem at hand.
It allows for code organization, reusability, and expressing solutions in different programming styles, promoting versatility and adaptability.
