What do we mean when we say that JavaScript is "dynamic"?

===

In web development, the word "dynamic" is used for client-side JavaScript and server-side languages:

- It means updating the display of a web page or app to show different things based on circumstances.
- Server-side code generates new content on the server, while client-side JavaScript generates new content in the browser.
- Both approaches often work together, but with slightly different meanings.

A web page without dynamic updates is "static," meaning it shows the same content all the time.
