**Object-oriented programming** or **OOP** is a fundamental paradigm in many languages, including JavaScript.

OOP models a system as {{c1::objects}}, each representing a specific aspect.
These {{c1::objects}} encapsulate both {{c1::functions (methods)}} and {{c1::data}}.
They provide a {{c1::public interface}} while maintaining {{c1::private state}}, enabling {{c1::other parts of the system to interact}} without {{c1::knowing the object's internal workings}}.

In OOP, the {{c1::**class**}} is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of these {{c1::objects}}.
It serves as a reusable template for creating multiple {{c1::class **instances**}}.
