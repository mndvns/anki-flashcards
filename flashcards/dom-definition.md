What is the DOM and what does it do?

===

The DOM (Document Object Model) is a way to interact with web pages using JavaScript:

- It represents the structure and content of a web page as a tree-like structure.
- You can use JavaScript to find, modify, and create elements on the page.
- You can change text, attributes, and styles.
- It allows you to respond to user actions, like clicks or key presses.

In simpler terms, the DOM lets you control and modify web pages to make them interactive and dynamic.
